# Cat-Classifier-Using-Logistic-Regression

> A very simple Classifier using Logistic Regression.

```
It mainly contains the following steps:  
1. Packages import  
2. Data loading and preprocessing(standardize)  
3. Helper functions building(including sigmoid function, initiialize function, forward and backward propagation functions, optimization function, prediction)  
4. All helper functions in a model merge  
5. Postprocess
```

The details of the whole algorithm can be found in **Logistic-Regression-Classifier.ipynb**.
